            <p>My initial exposure to programming began when I was still pursuing a degree in electrical engineering, taking a course in C, and another course that utilized MATLAB. I have been programming with JavaScript as my primary language for a little over a year, mainly creating projects intended to improve my understanding of the language and its rapidly evolving built-in library. I have numerous projects that are still in development/polishing phase, but my portfolio is available upon request. Below is a list of the most valuable skills that Iâ€™ve learned that reflect the current trend of modern web-development/programming paradigms.
